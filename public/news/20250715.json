        "content": "The Local Government (Water Services) Bill moved to the next stage as Parliament backed the 'Water Done Well' reforms, aimed at delivering enduring, publicly owned water services through new water organisations and updated governance. The Finance and Expenditure Committee produced 367 amendments, strengthening accountability, and setting two new statutory objectives to underpin housing growth and efficient water infrastructure. While supporters praised the plan to secure reliable drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater systems, critics warned of rate pressures and the risk of central intervention.
